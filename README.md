### Contributing
Contributing is key in this project. Any issues will be handled by the Git 
Master (@srepollock). Please email or label any issues are to be labelled in 
[Redmine](http://btechgames.bcit.ca/redmine/projects/term2-comp8051-crnk-studios?jump=welcome)
and labelled accordingly, (see [Issues](#issues) for details).  
Please follow all rules listed, and issues can be resolved quickly and 
efficiently for such a short project timeline.
#### Files and Naming
Files are to be given Upper Camel Case names.  
> *Example*: ViewController.swift

Naming of class variables are to be given Underscore Lower Camel Case names.  
>*Example*: _nameString

Naming of methods/functions are to be given Lower Camel Case.
>*Example*: setString
#### Coding Style
Please use the [Allman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style) 
Coding style conventions:
```
while (x == y) {
    something();
    somethingElse();
}
```
#### Comment Style
Comments are important so we know what functions are. Try if you can to use XML 
style comments, however because we are in a time limited contest, just single 
line comments will work.
```
// This is a single line comment in Swift
```
```
/**
    SetString
    [Summary]

    param: string: [name] - [what is it]
    return: bool: [what is it]
 */
bool setString(string s)
{
    return _s = s;
}
```
#### Commits
Commit messages are important. It's a quick "here's what's up and what I did" 
without having to read through all the changes and figure out what happened.  
Please use the first 140 characters of the commit message as a message for what 
the main changes in the commit were, and the rest of the message can be a bit 
more detailed. Paragraphs are not expected at all, just a little bit of 
information goes a long way.
#### Branches
Branching. One of the best features of Git. Please, please, please, branch 
using the format below. It will keep everything clean, and make sure the files 
you are working on are not being touched by anyone else on the same branch. It 
helps merge conflicts immensly.
- `feature/[type of feature]`: Use `feature` branches for any new updates or 
changes being added to the project.
- `hotfix/[issue number from Redmine]`: Use `hotfix` as a fix for any Redmine 
fixes or hotfixes.  

Sticking to proper branching a lot of things can go right.
#### Pull Requests
Pull requests are how changes are going to be merged into master.
> **Please do not push to `master` directly as it can cause a lot of issues and 
we are only to push our final updates or releases to `master` branch**  

When making a pull request, type out a message of what was changed overall, 
what was worked on, any bug issues (using Redmine and labelling issue tags) 
that arose during development.
### Comments
Communication is key and keeping ontop of it is what leads to succesful 
projects. Any quick questions or comments are done in Slack. Email and text is 
always valid. Just make sure to update the group on any changes or what is 
going to be worked on by individuals at any time.  
*Good luck and have fun!*
